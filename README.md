# AR Application for Dynamic 3D Flag Display

üåç *Project*: AR Application for Dynamic 3D Flag Display  
üîπ *Tech Stack*: Unity, Vuforia SDK  

## Overview
This augmented reality (AR) project showcases a dynamic 3D flag display when a smartphone or tablet camera views a specific country's map. By leveraging Unity and Vuforia SDK, this application seamlessly integrates digital content with real-world visuals, offering an interactive and engaging experience for users.

## Features
- *AR-Based Flag Display*: Recognizes specific country maps and dynamically displays the corresponding 3D flag.
- *Immersive Experience*: Provides a realistic and interactive AR experience using Unity and Vuforia.
- *Cross-Device Compatibility*: Works on both smartphones and tablets.

## Tech Stack
- *Unity*: Used for creating the 3D environment and managing interactions.
- *Vuforia SDK*: Powers the AR functionality, enabling map recognition and flag display.

## How It Works
1. *Map Recognition*: The Vuforia SDK detects and recognizes specific country maps.
2. *3D Flag Rendering*: Once a map is recognized, a 3D model of the corresponding country's flag is displayed in AR.
3. *Interactive Viewing*: Users can move around the map to view the flag from different angles.

## Installation
1. *Unity Setup*:
   - Install Unity and add the Vuforia Engine package.
   - Import the 3D flag models and set up the scene.
2. *Vuforia Configuration*:
   - Register for a Vuforia Developer account and set up an AR database.
   - Add the specific country maps to the database as target images.
3. *Build and Deploy*:
   - Build the project for Android or iOS and deploy it to a smartphone or tablet.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for additional countries and flags.
- Include more interactive elements like national anthems or historical facts.

## Acknowledgments
This project demonstrates the potential of AR in creating engaging, real-world interactive experiences. The combination of Unity and Vuforia SDK enabled the seamless integration of 3D content into real-world environments.
